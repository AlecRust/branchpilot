This is a simple PR example showing the minimum required fields.

## What this demonstrates

- **Minimal configuration** — Only `branch` and `when` are required
- **Simple date format** — Uses your system timezone by default
- **Clean PR body** — The markdown content below the last `---` becomes the PR description

## Usage

Place this file in any directory scanned by branchpilot. When the `when` timestamp passes, a PR will be created automatically.
